#+title: Test org on Git
#+OPTIONS: \n:t 

When I create org documents I make sure that I have this setting in my init.el file:

'(org-export-preserve-breaks t)

One can also use #+OPTIONS: \n:t  on a file-per-file basis to force org to preserve all line breaks when exporting. This works fine when I export an org file using C-c C-e. However, if I upload the org file to Git, it does not display with the line breaks. For example:

Line 1
Line 2
Line 2
Line 4

Displays as

Line 1 Line 2 Line 2 Line 4

I have tried adding \\ at the end of each line, but when uploaded to Git, it appears as

Line\1\Line\2\Line 2\Line 4

I would like it simply to appear as

Line 1
Line 2
Line 2
Line 4
